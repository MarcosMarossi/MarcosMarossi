My name is Marcos ðŸ˜‰, and I am a software developer with 3 years of experience in developing Java, JavaScript and TypeScript.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, attending hackathons and coding events, and collaborating with other developers to solve challenging problems. I believe that continuous learning is crucial in the fast-paced world of software development, and I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and tools.
